# HEPML Resources

## Table of contents

- [General ML Info](#general-machine-learning-information)
- [Lectures](#lectures)
- [Jupyter Notebooks](#notebooks)
- [Papers](#papers)
- [Workshops](#workshops)

Listing of useful (mostly) public learning resources for machine learning applications in high energy physics (HEPML). Listings will be in reverse chronological order (like a CV).

> **N.B.:** This listing will almost certainly be biased towards work done by ATLAS scientists, as the maintainer is a member of ATLAS and so sees ATLAS work the most. However, this is not the desired case and help to diversify this listing would be greatly appreciated.
